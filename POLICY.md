# Privacy Policy

### Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines how our Chrome browser extension, which enables email prototype tools for Adobe XD, collects, uses, and protects user information. We respect our users' privacy and are committed to safeguarding the personal data collected.

### Required Permissions
To ensure the proper and secure operation of the extension, we request the following permissions:

- **Clipboard Access**: Permission to copy and write data directly to the user's clipboard, necessary for the functionality of copying emails.
- **Domain and Tab Identification**: Permission to identify the active domain and tab to facilitate DOM manipulation and insert specific buttons related to the extension’s functionality.

### Use of Remote Code
The extension uses remote JavaScript code to:

- Insert new buttons into the Adobe XD prototype
- Manipulate the page’s DOM to copy emails
This is done using references to external files in `<script>` tags, modules pointing to external sources, and strings evaluated via `eval()`

### Data Collection and Usage

**Collected Data**: The extension collects limited information, including the accessed domain and the content to be manipulated or copied to the clipboard.
Data Usage: The data collected is exclusively used to provide the extension's core functionalities, such as inserting buttons and copying emails.

### Data Sharing

- We do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, except when strictly necessary for the approved use cases of the extension's functionality
- We do not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to the extension's primary objective

### Data Usage Prohibitions

We do not use or transfer user data to determine credibility, credit scores, or for any purpose related to loans or financial analyses.

### Security
We implement reasonable measures to protect collected data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no internet transmission or electronic system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### User Consent
By installing and using this extension, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be communicated to users through the Chrome Web Store or other appropriate channels.
